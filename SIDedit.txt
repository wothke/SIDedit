NAME

    SIDedit - A Perl/Tk GUI based application to read and edit binary SID
    files.

DESCRIPTION

    This Perl/Tk GUI application allows the user to read, write and edit
    binary SID files, which are music player and data routines converted
    from the Commodore-64 computer with an additional informational header
    prepended. SIDedit has become a useful tool for people ripping SID tunes
    out of Commodore-64 executables.

    Most of the application's common functions should be obvious, and for
    some of the less obvious ones tooltips provide additional hints.

    This tool is intended for programmers, SID rippers, or other people with
    reasonable background. It is not suitable for newbies who have never
    before used hexadecimal numbers, who are not familiar with the
    Commodore-64 computer's internals or with the SID file format (click
    *Help -* SID file format> on the menu for the format specification).

USAGE

  A SHORT TUTORIAL: I JUST RIPPED A TUNE - NOW WHAT?

    Let's say you just ripped a SID tune and it's sitting on your hard drive
    as a Commodore-64 executable and you want to turn it into a standard SID
    file so it can be incorporated into the High Voltage SID Collection.

    Let's assume that your freshly ripped tune is in a file called
    Ripped.prg. (SIDedit recognizes a file as a C64 data file only if its
    extension is one of .prg, .p00, .c64 or .dat.) Start up SIDedit, check
    the List C64 data files checkbox and navigate to the directory where
    this file can be found. Click on the file. SIDedit will ask you whether
    you want to load it as SID data. Answer yes. SIDedit also asks you
    whether you want to reset the SID header data to the defaults. For now
    answer yes to this question, too. The binary data from Ripped.prg gets
    loaded into SIDedit.

    Now all you have to do is edit the SID header and save the resulting
    file. Remember that when you change any field in the *SID header* in
    SIDedit, you are editing an in-memory copy of the SID file, not the SID
    file itself! Once you are done with your changes, you'll have to save
    them to a file to make the changes permanent.

    First, decide whether your rip is PlaySID compatible or requires a real
    C64 environment to play properly. See the next section below for a
    detailed discussion about this. When you decided, set the *Environment*
    field to your choice.

    Then, make sure that the *Load range* displayed in SIDedit is the same
    as the one you used when you saved the file. If it isn't, enter the load
    address in the *loadAddress* field and make sure the Always save as PSID
    v2NG/RSID option is checked in the *Configure settings* window under the
    *File navigator* tab, otherwise leave the *loadAddress* field at 0.
    (NOTE: if you selected *Real C64* as the rip's environment, you can't
    edit the *loadAddress* field!)

    Then, at a minimum, you should edit the *initAddress* and *playAddress*
    hexadecimal fields (leave *playAddress* as 0 only if the initialization
    routine of the ripped tune installs an interrupt player itself - this
    will always be set to 0 for *Real C64* rips and you won't be able to
    change it), the *songs* and *startSong* decimal fields (both should be
    at least 1), and, of course, the textual *name*, *author* and *released*
    fields that should conform to HVSC standards (read the HVSC FAQ for
    details on that or hover with the mouse over those fields to see their
    tooltips for examples).

    If certain (or all) subsongs of your rip use different timers, you might
    also want to edit the *speed* field. (NOTE: You can't do this if your
    rip is a *Real C64* rip.) The easiest way to do this is to click on the
    Edit speed bits button, where you can set the speed of the individual
    subsongs. Due to the SID file format's limitation, subsongs #32 and
    higher are all represented by 1 bit only, so they'll all have the same
    speed. This is rarely a problem, though.

    Next you should edit the *flags* field. Again, instead of typing in the
    actual hexadecimal value for this field it's easier if you simply click
    on the Edit the flags button. Here you can specify whether your rip uses
    a built- in player or not (it most likely does), and whether it's fully
    C64 compatible or it's PlaySID specific (note: this latter setting is
    not an available choice for *Real C64* rips). For example, if your rip
    plays digi samples and you didn't alter the original player routine,
    it's definitely a fully C64 compatible rip. If you modified the player
    routine so that it plays the digi samples via the extended PlaySID
    registers (not recommended), then you should definitely check the
    PlaySID specific checkbutton. For *Real C64* rips check the C64 BASIC
    executable checkbox if the ripped tunes uses BASIC instructions.

    You should also specify here whether the tune you ripped was intended
    for PAL or NTSC machines (or maybe it works on both), and also whether
    it was intended by its author to be played on a 6581 or 8580 chip (or
    maybe both). Then press Done, and the *flags* field will be
    automatically updated for you.

    To help SID emulators determine where they should install their
    interrupt routines, you may want to specify the area of memory that is
    definitely not used by your ripped tune. Usually this is a problem only
    when the initialization or player routine reads or writes to memory that
    is outside the *Load range*. If this is the case, you should specify the
    address of the first free 256 byte large memory page in *startPage* and
    the number of free pages following that in *pageLength*. For example,
    startPage = $30 and pageLength = $10 indicates that the memory area
    between $3000 and $3FFF is never touched by your ripped tune.

    A common example for how to fill out the different SID fields is below:

    *   *Environment*: *PlaySID*

    *   *loadAddress*: $0000 (or set it to the actual load address if *Load
        range* shows a seemingly incorrect memory range)

    *   *initAddress*: $1000

    *   *playAddress*: $1003

    *   *songs*: 1

    *   *startSong*: 1

    *   *speed*: 0x00000000 (indicating the the tune uses the vertical sync
        for timing)

    *   *name*: My Love is Infinite

    *   *author*: John Doe

    *   *released*: 2004 BoyBand

    *   *flags*: 0x0014 (indicating a fully C64 compatible rip with a
        built-in player that was intended for PAL machines and to be played
        back on 6581 chips)

    *   *startPage*: $00 (indicating that the rip is "clean", i.e. it
        doesn't write outside its *Load range*)

    *   *pageLength*: $00 (if *startPage* is $00, *pageLength* should be
        $00, too)

    Now click on the Create HVSC compliant filename button. This will -
    surprisingly - create an HVSC compliant filename out of the SID's name,
    in this case it'll create the filename My_Love_is_Infinite.sid. Then
    make sure the Always save as PSID v2NG/RSID option is checked in the
    *Configure settings* window and save the file by clicking on the Save
    file button on the toolbar. That's it! (You can also save the SID file
    to a different directory by choosing File - Save as...> from the menu.)

    If you ripped more than one tune from the same author, you might want to
    do the following to save you from typing in his name for every rip:
    after doing the above procedure, make sure the little checkbuttons by
    the *author* and *released* fields are checked and all the other ones
    are not. Make sure the Edit - Copy format -> Selected fields only> menu
    option is also checked, then select Edit - Copy> from the menu or press
    CTRL-C. This will copy the above two SID fields as text to the
    clipboard. Now you can go on and add a SID header to your next rip as
    outlined above, but instead of typing in the author and release info,
    simply select Edit - Paste> from the menu or press CTRL-V.

  A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT SETTING (PlaySID vs. Real C64)

    You'll notice there is a setting labeled *Environment* that can be set
    either to PlaySID or to Real C64. When it is set to PlaySID, SIDedit
    will save the SID to a valid PSID v1 or v2/v2NG file depending on the
    other settings. When it is set to Real C64, the data will always be
    saved to an RSID (RealSID) file, which is basically a PSID v2NG file
    with its magic ID set to 'RSID' instead of 'PSID'.

    The main difference between the two settings is that Real C64 indicates
    that the rip requires a true Commodore-64 environment to operate
    properly and won't even play in (or might even crash!) older libsidplay1
    and PlaySID compatible SID emulators. The advantage of RSID files is
    that they can be run on a real C64 unmodified. For this reasons it is
    highly recommended to save every SID file as an RSID (Real C64 file).
    See the SID_file_format.txt file included with SIDedit for further
    details (it is discussed under the 'magicID' field).

    Setting the environment to Real C64 also enforces additional
    restrictions on top of PSID v2NG: it automatically sets the
    *loadAddress*, *playAddress* and *speed* fields to 0 and modifying these
    fields is no longer possible, plus changing the bit in the *flags* field
    to make the file *PlaySID specific* will be no longer possible, either.
    Also, the *initAddress* and the relocation range indicated by
    *startPage* and *pageLength* cannot be inside or overlap the ROM/IO
    ($A000-$BFFF and $D000-$FFFF) areas, *initAddress* cannot be lower than
    $07E8 and the relocation range cannot overlap the reserved memory area
    ($0000-$03FF).

  DISPLAYING, EDITING AND SAVING THE C64 DATA

    When you press the Display SID data button, a new window pops up. Here
    you can select whether you want to display the *data* portion of a SID
    file as a Hex dump, or as disassembled machine code (Assembly
    checkbutton), or as disassembled machine code showing the illegal
    instructions, too. Note that when you display the data as Hex dump, for
    your convenience C64 ASCII characters (both uppercase and lowercase)
    will be shown as standard ASCII characters on the screen. Also note that
    when the data is shown as assembly code, you can click on certain jump
    and branch addresses to jump to that address directly without scrolling
    to it. Also, when you switch from assembly to hex dump mode or vice
    versa, the topmost line of the display will be at approximately the same
    address where it was in the previous display mode.

    You can specify the first memory address from which the data will be
    shown by choosing either the Load address, the initAddress, the
    playAddress, or an arbitrary memory address (Other) as the starting
    point for the display.

   SAVING SID DATA

    You can also save the C64 *data* portion of a SID to a file by clicking
    the Save data to file button. Choosing the as binary option will save it
    to a standard C64 binary file with a .prg extension, while choosing the
    as displayed option will save the actual content of the data display
    into a plain text file. Choosing the as 64 KB memory image option will
    create a binary file with an .img extension that is exactly 65536 bytes
    large and is basically a snapshot of the C64's 64 KB memory with the
    *data* portion of the SID file at the appropriate memory address
    location. Therefore, if you hex edit the resulting .img file, the
    offsets in your hex editor will match that of the actual offsets when
    the *data* is loaded into the C64's memory.

   CHANGING THE SIZE OF THE SID DATA

    The window also gives you an opportunity to change the size of the C64
    *data*. You can enter a new load range for the *data* in the Trim/pad
    data section. If the new range you specify is greater than the current
    load range at either end, the C64 *data* gets filled with zeros
    accordingly. If the new range you specify is smaller than the current
    load range at either end, the C64 *data* portion gets trimmed (chopped)
    as specified. Pressing the Trim/pad data button carries out the change
    and it also updates the appropriate SID header data. WARNING: if you
    reduce the *data* portion there's no other way of getting back the cut
    data other than reloading the file! Be careful with this button!

   MODIFYING BYTES IN SID DATA

    Finally, you can also modify a contiguous string of bytes in the *data*
    portion by clicking on Modify bytes. This is very useful if you want to
    add, say, a short sequence of assembly instructions to the SID data.

    First specify the C64 address from which you want to modify bytes, then
    specify the bytes that you want to change it to in the format of "xx xx
    xx ..." where 'xx' are hexadecimal bytes. For example, setting At
    address to $1000 and the change bytes to to "AB BA" will change the C64
    *data* portion at $1000 to hex $AB and at $1001 to hex $BA. Needless to
    say, don't do byte modifications unless you are absolutely sure about
    what you are doing as you can really mess up the SID file with incorrect
    byte modifications here.

  FILE NAVIGATOR

    The left-hand side of the main SIDedit window is dedicated to the file
    navigator. You can use the file navigator to browse directories, load
    SID files into SIDedit, play SID files by double-clicking on them, etc.
    If the directory listing is long, you can also type the first few
    letters of the file or directory you'd like to jump to after making the
    given listbox active by rolling your mouse pointer over it.

    The file navigator also has its own toolbar. Besides the usual buttons,
    like Go to parent directory, Create new directory and Delete selected
    directory there are also a few so-called directory shortcut buttons. You
    can use these to jump directly to certain frequently used directories,
    like to the directory where you usually save your SID files to, or to go
    to your HVSC directory. You configure where these shortcuts point to on
    the Configure settings window under the File navigator tab.

  LOADING INFO FILES

    SIDedit is also capable of loading SID header data from so-called INFO
    files which usually have a *.sid* file extension. These files were part
    of a now obsolete two-file SID file format.

    Check the List INFO files checkbox at the top of the file navigator in
    SIDedit to see a list of such files in the file navigator. Once you
    click on an INFO file, SIDedit will ask you whether you want to overload
    the current SID header data in the memory with the one contained in the
    INFO file. Answer yes to carry out this operation.

  PLAYING YOUR RIP IN A SID EMULATOR

    After saving a SID file you probably want to make sure it plays
    correctly in your favorite SID emulator. SIDedit can launch your
    favorite SID player with a selected file as outlined below.

    First, select the Tools tab in the Configure settings window to tell
    SIDedit which SID player you would like to use for this feature.

    Then you can launch your SID player either by clicking on the Play SID
    file button on the toolbar, or by double-clicking on the file. If you
    didn't configure a SID player, yet, SIDedit will automatically pop up
    the Configure settings window to prompt you for the location of the SID
    emulator you want to use to play the file.

  EDITING YOUR RIP WITH A HEX EDITOR

    You might also want to edit the *data* portion of the SID file after you
    saved the file. You can do this with your favorite hex editor from
    within SIDedit by clicking the Edit file with hex editor button on the
    toolbar.

    First, select the Tools tab in the Configure settings window to tell
    SIDedit which hex editor you would like to use for this feature.

    Then you can start your hex editor by clicking on the Edit file with hex
    editor button.

    If you didn't configure a hex editor, yet, SIDedit will automatically
    pop up the Configure settings window to prompt you for the location of
    the hex editor you want to use for this purpose.

  CHECKING YOUR RIP WITH AN EXTERNAL TOOL

    After saving a SID file you might want to run an external tool like
    SID2CRC to make sure that your rip is a pristine SID tune. Select the
    SID file in the file navigator then click the Run command line tool
    button on the toolbar. Here you can enter a command line that will
    execute your tool in a shell or choose from a list of previously
    executed tools (the list remembers the last 10 commands you ran and this
    list is also saved with other settings to SIDedit.INI).

    For example, assuming that sid2crc is in your path, enter *sid2crc -v
    -t80000 -m %f* at the command line entry. *%f* will be replaced with the
    full pathname of the file you selected in the file navigator. You can
    also use *%d* to substitute the full pathname of the current directory
    shown in the file navigator of SIDedit, or *%x* to subsitute the full
    pathname of the selected file without its extension. Now click the Run
    command line tool button and the command line you entered will be
    executed.

    The output of the command will appear in a new pop-up window. (If you
    see nothing here, the command you entered most likely failed.) There are
    two additional buttons on this window that also allow you to save the
    command's output to a file and to copy the contents of the output to the
    clipboard. You can also pop up this window any time by clicking the Run
    tool button in the main SIDedit window and then clicking Show last
    output or by choosing File - Show last output of tool...> from the menu
    - as its name suggests it will always show you the output of the most
    recent command you executed.

  SAVING YOUR SETTINGS

    When you quit SIDedit, it automatically saves your settings to a
    SIDedit.INI file that will be located in the same directory from where
    you started SIDedit itself. If you want to disable this feature, uncheck
    the Always save settings on exit option on the General tab in the
    Configure settings window and click Save settings now - from now on,
    SIDedit will read the settings from the SIDedit.INI file, but it won't
    save your changes to it when you quit the program. You can also force
    SIDedit to save the current settings to the SIDedit.INI file any time by
    clicking on the <Save settings now> in the same window.

    Note that besides all the settings available on the Configure settings
    menu, SIDedit also saves the settings of all the options available via
    the Edit menu, the list of the last 10 commands that were executed with
    the Run command line tool feature, plus the last size and position of
    the main SIDedit window and some other windows.

PREREQUISITES

    This script requires the following modules: Audio::SID Cwd
    File::Basename File::Copy Tk Tk::Balloon Tk::Checkbutton Tk::Dialog
    Tk::DialogBox Tk::Optionmenu Tk::Radiobutton Tk::ROText Tk::BrowseEntry
    Tk::LabFrame Tk::Scrollbar Tk::Button Tk::Entry Tk::Photo Tk::ToolBar
    Tk::NoteBook Tk::WaitBox Tk::DirTree

    On Win32 machines it also uses these modules: Win32 Win32::API
    Win32::Process Win32::Clipboard Win32API::File

KNOWN BUGS

    *   Data display rendering and clipboard operations are way too slow
        with colors (try new Perl/Tk?).

    *   Under UNIX bringing up the display data window caused a grab fail.
        (Bug in Perl/Tk?)

    *   On some systems if you press down on the mousewheel button and move
        down, the SID data scrolls up, and moving up scrolls down (it should
        be the other way around). (Bug in Perl/Tk.)

    *   There's a problem with the scrollbar on the data display window when
        "assembly" is selected: it doesn't always scroll all the way down
        when grabbed with the scrollblock. (Bug in Perl/Tk.)

    *   Checked items in the menu partially cover first letter of menu
        entry. (Bug in Perl/Tk.)

    *   After selecting File->New last file doesn't get deselected in the
        filelist. (Bug in Perl/Tk - can't deselect from listbox.)

    If you find any other bugs in this module, please, report them to the
    author (see "COPYRIGHT" below).

TO DO LIST

    *   Disassembly rendering (when jumping to address or switching views)
        should always re-start at proper address (instead of in the middle
        of an instruction).

    *   RunTool execution should have a WaitBox.

    *   Restrict Play SID file to actual SID/INFO files only.

    *   DirTree browser doesn't quite work in Win32. Try chooseDirectory
        instead?

    *   Add key bindings to Configure settings popup.

    *   Add popup to show quick summary of assembly codes.

    *   Add File -> Open... (rip out a Load function from FileSelect).

    *   Add "Load data" to SID data display.

    *   I'd like to have SIDedit remember the last x directories I worked
        in. Sometimes I quickly need to change between my rip directory and
        the HVSC directory to compare something, so it would be nice to
        implement a similar history function as in the RUN TOOL window. (Add
        <- and -> nav buttons!)

    *   Optimize Load/Save Settings code (hash! - use Config::IniHash or
        sg).

    *   Optimize Settings screen code (map!).

    *   Add right-click menu to file navigator. Prune right-click menu on
        SID data and text display? (Selection problem!)

    *   Add mm file analyzation support, see SidUsage files!

    *   Change "name" field to "Title" (In Audio::SID, too).

    *   Add an info field to "Show SID Data" that shows which SID player
        engine is used.

    *   Add option to allow users to revert back to standard copy/paste
        operations (i.e. select a field, copy it). (BUT:
        $window->clipboardPaste() doesn't work, neither does $window->insert
        - great...)

    *   Add a button called "Batch processing". In there one option would be
        to generate a text output of checked fields recursively in current
        dir, another option would be to change the checked fields in all
        files recursively to what is in current file.

    *   Simon: I still wish something could be done about it like say
        combining load address and range (make load address always reflect
        the range start address). Then by changing load address you'll see
        the range change. Also might be nice if you then click display data
        the new load address is used... You could even combine load address
        and range into a single line.

    *   Keep the ShowSIDData and ShowTextOutput windows on screen, don't
        grab, so they can be displayed side-by-side.

    *   Add Dag's code to fill out startPage and pageLength automatically.

    *   Add ability to recurse dirs and autoconvert SID files as per
        specified options.

    *   Load MD5s from expanded Songlengths DB to find SIDs already in HVSC.

    *   Allow siddiag duplicate match against HVSC. Or in general
        incorporate a duplicate finder?

    *   Add ability to search every field of every SID found in HVSC and/or
        other specified directories. Sort of like SidBace. Build a text DB
        for this. Add search capability for Songlength DB, STIL, etc.

VERSION HISTORY

  v4.02+ (11/08/2020 by Tiny'R'Sid)

    *   Added "List all files" option so that binaries can be loaded without 
        having to rename them to "*.prg" first.

    *   Added browsing support for Windows folder names containing non-ASCII 
        characters.

    *   Added "selection replace" when pasting into directory field.

    *   Fixed flawed regexp so it no longer crashes for windows filenames
        containing dots or brackets.

    *   Disassembly view now uses regular 3-char mnemonics for illegal opcodes.

    *   Patched so it works with Perl and module versions still available today.

  v4.02 (03/13/2004)

    *   (added) All illegal assembly instructions are colored red in the
        data display when syntax coloring is turned on.

    *   (added) A line consisting of dashes is displayed after every JMP and
        RTS instruction in the data display to improve readability.

    *   (added) Added configuration setting "Automatically create HVSC
        compliant filename when 'name' field changes". Turning on this
        setting automatically changes the filename to be HVSC compliant
        whenever the 'name' field changes, and it also gets rid of the
        pop-up confirmation window when the "Create HVSC compliant filename"
        button is pressed.

    *   (fixed) Added missing '$' signs when displaying conditional branch
        instruction addresses in the data display.

  v4.01 (02/15/2004)

    *   (added) New setting to turn off syntax coloring in data display to
        speed up display and clipboard operations.

    *   (added) Version history in the POD.

    *   (added) Broke up content of INI file into 4 sections within the file
        for better readability.

    *   (fixed) Colors were one off on the hex data display.

    *   (fixed) There was a problem entering the "Other" address in the data
        display. It caused focus problem, data rendering problem, etc. The
        address entry is now enabled permanently.

  v4.00 (02/02/2004)

    You'll notice that the user interface of SIDedit has undergone some
    significant upgrades which will hopefully make it easier to use. The
    basic functionality of SIDedit hasn't changed much, though.

    IMPORTANT: If you're installing this version of SIDedit over the old
    one, I strongly advise you to -DELETE- your existing SIDedit.ini file to
    remove the chance of some weird bug happening. Upon first starting
    SIDedit v4.00, select "Tools" -> "Configure settings", then click "Save
    settings now" to re-create the SIDedit.ini file.

    If you are using the UNIX/Perl version (i.e the SIDedit.pl file from the
    tarball) you'll notice that you'll have to install a few new Perl/Tk
    modules to get SIDedit running. It's inconvenient, I know, but it was
    the only way I could add some cool new widgets to the tool.

    *   (added) Added support for the new 'C64 BASIC' RSID flag. (Thanks to
        Simon White!) Click on "Edit flags" to set or clear this flag.

    *   (added) Added rudimentary support to modify a continuous string of
        bytes in the SID data itself. See "Display SID data" -> "Modify
        bytes". Consult the "Modifying Bytes in SID Data" section of the
        "Help" -> "Quick tutorial" guide for details on its usage. (WARNING:
        You can really mess up a SID file with this, so use it with extreme
        care!)

    *   (added) Major overhaul of the user interface includes (but is not
        limited to):

        *
              (added)
                SIDedit now uses menus and toolbars for easy access
                to most functions.

        *
              (added)
                Help screens use external files.

        *
              (added)
                File -> New to reset SID data to defaults.

        *
              (added)
                File -> Save as... to save file to arbitrary location.

        *
              (added)
                The main window and the data display make use of colors.

        *
              (added)
                In the data display window it is now possible to click
                on the jump/branch addresses to jump to that location
                directly (if that location can be displayed in the window).

        *
              (added)
                In the data display window switching between hex dump
                and assembly listings retains the currently displayed
                address range in the window.

        *
              (added)
                All the settings are now configurable via a separate
                "Configure settings" popup window.

        *
              (added)
                Experimental mousewheel support. (NOTE: on some systems
                if you press down on the mousewheel button and move down,
                the window contents scroll up, and moving up scrolls them
                down instead of the other way around. This seems to be a
                bug in Perl/Tk itself.)

        *
              (added)
                The file navigator window pane also got its own toolbar
                with 3 directory "shortcuts" (default dir, default save
                dir, HVSC dir) which are configurable via the "Configure
                settings" popup window. You can use these shortcuts to
                jump to those dirs without navigating to them.

        *
              (added)
                Toolbar icons that are lifted from Tk::Toolbar -> tkIcons.

        *
              (added)
                Errors that would be displayed on the command line are now
                displayed in an error message box.

        *
              (added)
                Window positions are retained and also saved to
                configuration file.

        *
              (added)
                "Please wait" popup window when SID data display rendering
                takes a long time.

        *
              (added)
                Jumping between hex and assembly display in the SID data
                display retains location from the previous display mode.

    *   (added) The POD is now in its separate .pod file.

    *   (added) Added "%x" command line substitution pattern to the "Run
        Tool" feature to allow full pathname without file extension.

    *   (fixed) Additional verification of playAddress and initAddress
        fields.

    *   (fixed) Pressing delete and backspace in the SID fields will also
        flag the in-memory file as modified.

    *   (fixed) Sub-windows now properly take and release focus.

    *   (fixed) InitAddress and playAddress are grayed out in the SID data
        display if they are zero.

    *   (fixed) Saving a file with the same name but different case now
        saves the file with the new cases.

    *   (fixed) If "List INFO files" is checked, loading of data files is no
        longer messed up.

    *   (fixed) Lots and lots of small bugfixes. Hopefully, I managed to fix
        all the bugs that were reported since the previous version was
        released. :)

    Some of you might notice that in the Windows version of SIDedit there is
    no "Browse" button next to the directory shortcut entries in the
    "Configure settings" window. Unfortunately, this is due to a shortcoming
    of the Perl/Tk interface and hopefully it'll be fixed when Tk-804 is
    released.

  v3.02 (11/22/2002)

    *   (added) Changed the "copyright" field name to "released".

    *   (fixed) The load range wasn't calculated correctly when the
        relocation range was checked, causing incorrect error reports before
        saving an RSID file.

    *   (fixed) The lowest acceptable load and init address in RSID files
        was lowered to $07E8. (Ask Simon if you are curious why. :)

  v3.01 (11/03/2002)

    *   (fixed) There was a bug in the code that was checking the relocation
        range for RSID files, it sometimes reported a perfectly valid
        relocation range (e.g. startPage = $9F, pageLength = $01) as
        invalid. It won't do that any more.

  v3.00 (10/29/2002)

    *   (added) The tool's name was changed from PSIDedit to SIDedit. Note
        that this means that you'll have to rename your PSIDedit.ini file to
        SIDedit.ini and change the first line in it to "[SIDedit]" if you
        want to retain your old settings!

    *   (added) The tool requires the new Audio::SID v3.00 module to work
        (if you're using the Win32 executable, you don't have to worry about
        this).

    *   (added) There's a new field labeled "Environment" in the SID header
        section. You can select either "PlaySID" (PSID) or "Real C64" (RSID)
        here. This basically sets the magic ID in the SID file to PSID or
        RSID. Selecting RSID enforces additional restrictions over PSID v2NG
        - see the included documentation for details.

    *   (added) Additional full support for RSID, like relocation info
        fields.

    *   (added) The "HVSC Filename" button is now called "Create HVSC
        Filename". Hopefully, this'll make its function a bit more
        understandable.

    *   (added) With the new name comes a slightly different icon - thanks
        to Peter Sandén for taking the time to create it for me! :)

    *   (fixed) If you change the loadAddress field, its new value is now
        properly reflected in the data display window, too.

    *   (fixed) Changing the CLOCK field didn't automatically regenerate the
        MD5 fingerprint. Fixed it.

    *   (fixed) Pressing CTRL+<Key> or ALT+<Key> (and nothing else) in the
        text entry fields of the SID header no longer pops up the "Save
        file?" dialog window if you move to another file right away.

    *   (fixed) The "funny" texts on buttons of error popup windows are
        gone. Apparently, many of you didn't think they were funny. So, now
        the only button you can press there simply says "OK".

    *   (fixed) The "Run tool" feature didn't work properly if the full
        pathname of the file you tried to operate on contained a space.
        Fixed it.

    *   (fixed) Many other minor internal enhancements made to the tool.

  v2.12 (PSIDedit) (09/18/2002)

    *   (added) The "HVSC Filename" button will automatically append "_PSID"
        to the filename if the PlaySID flag is set. (Although the filename
        might still require some manual editing to make it "look better".)

    *   (added) In almost all dialog boxes you can now press hotkeys, too.
        If the hotkeys don't seem to work, try CTRL+hotkey or ALT+hotkey.
        For example, in a Yes/No dialog box you can simply press the "Y" or
        "N" keys to answer the question. In the "Data display" window you
        can press CTRL+O to close the window.

    *   (fixed) The "HVSC Filename" button now handles "+" signs in titles
        correctly.

    *   (fixed) Zero-length filenames are no longer allowed when saving.

    *   (fixed) The MD5 fingerprints are now calculated with the new
        algorithm (so for files in HVSC they will match those found in the
        latest songlength database).

  v2.11 (PSIDedit) (08/21/2002)

    *   (fixed) Minor bugfixes in HVSC compliant filename generation.

    *   (fixed) Removed references to "Amiga" in speed bit edit popup.

  v2.10 (PSIDedit) (08/05/2002)

    *   (added) Ability to load INFO files (these are text files that were
        part of the now obsolete .dat + .sid two-file format). PSIDedit also
        handles newer INFO files that contain PSID v2NG fields in them.

    *   (added) A new button called "Run tool" allows the user to run any
        external tool in a command shell right from PSIDedit. The output of
        such commands is captured in a window - the contents of this window
        can then be saved to a file or copied to the clipboard. This new
        button was added mainly to allow rippers to run sid2crc right from
        PSIDedit which allows them to check SID files. PSIDedit will
        remember the last 10 command lines entered here and this command
        list is also saved to the PSIDedit.ini file with other settings.

    *   (added) On the "Display C64 data" window a new button was added
        called "Trim/pad data" that allows the user to alter the size of the
        C64 data in a PSID file. This is great to trim a ripped file to get
        rid of superfluous bytes from it.

    *   (added) Pressing an alphanumeric key when the dir/file browser is in
        focus will cycle thru the dirs/files that begin with that letter. If
        you start typing rapidly, the first file whose name starts with the
        typed letters will be highlighted, similar to Windows Explorer.

    *   (added) When moving up the dir hierarchy via the dir browser the
        previous directory's name will be automatically highlighted (instead
        of the name of the very first dir entry).

    *   (fixed) Minor bugfixes in the "HVSC filename" feature that generates
        an HVSC-compliant filename based on the "name" field.

    *   (fixed) Copying data to the clipboard INFO style had some bugs in
        it. Got rid of them. Similarly, pasting INFO style data from the
        clipboard was also buggy. Fixed that, too.

    *   (fixed) Loading data files (.dat, .prg, etc.) will no longer reset
        the PSID header data to defaults automatically. You now have a
        choice whether to keep the PSID header data or not. This will save
        you a copy-paste step when, for example, constructing several SID
        files in a row from data files that were ripped from the same
        author.

    *   (fixed) If you tried to play a SID file under Windows whose full
        pathname contained a space, SIDPlay/Win used to give an error. Fixed
        it.

    *   (fixed) Other minor (mostly internal) enhancements.

  v2.02 (PSIDedit) (07/22/2002)

    *   (fixed) Apostrophe handling for titles containg 'n' and underscores
        when creating HVSC compliant filename.

  v2.01 (PSIDedit) (04/22/2002)

    *   (added) New tooltips were added to the 'author' and 'copyright'
        fields to show the suggested format for those fields (actually, that
        is pretty much how HVSC requires them to look like - consult the
        /DOCUMENTS/hv_sids.txt file of your HVSC collection for details).

    *   (fixed) Fixed a minor bug in the 'songs' and 'startSong' entry
        fields.

    *   (fixed) The tabbing order amongst the PSID header fields is now a
        bit more convenient (TAB won't cycle through the little checkboxes
        any more).

  v2.00 (PSIDedit) (04/02/2002)

    *   (added) Complete support of the PSID v2NG file format specification.

    *   (added) Individual bits in the 'speed' and 'flags' fields can be
        edited via user-friendly pop-up windows.

    *   (added) Ability to launch a SID emulator to play a tune right from
        PSIDedit.

    *   (added) Ability to launch a hex editor from within PSIDedit to edit
        the binary contents of a .sid file.

    *   (added) A brand new C64 data display window allows the user to
        examine the contents of a SID tune either as a hex dump (where C64
        ASCII characters are also translated to standard ASCII characters)
        or as disassembled machine code (with or without illegal
        instructions),

    *   (added) More control over which PSID header fields will be copied to
        and pasted from the clipboard (this is very handy when you are
        turning many rips from the same author into .sid files, it saves you
        from a lot of typing).

    *   (added) Configuration settings are stored in an .ini file.

    *   (added) PSIDedit icon.

    *   (added) On-the-fly verification of many editable fields.

    *   (added) Win32 specific support for clipboard operations.

    *   (added) Drive selection support under Win32 systems.

    *   (added) More robust error checking with error message popup window.

    *   (added) Directory operations (delete, create, etc.).

    *   (added) More extensive tooltips.

    *   (added) More extensive tutorial on usage.

  v1.60c (PSIDedit) (01/23/2002)

    *   (added) MD5 fingerprint is updated on the fly as the PSID header is
        edited.

    *   (added) PSIDedit is now also available as a standalone Windows
        executable! No installation needed - just run it and enjoy. :) But
        since it was created with the evaluation version of Perl2EXE, you'll
        see a nag-window come up after you close PSIDedit.

    *   (fixed) HVSC root filename is only 26 characters long, not 27.

  v1.60b (PSIDedit) (01/20/2002)

    *   (added) You can now not only copy PSID header information to the
        clipboard, but you can also paste properly formatted header info
        from the clipboard into the PSID file you are editing by pressing
        the new "Paste" button. To find out what "properly formatted" means,
        simply load a PSID file, press "Copy", then paste what was just
        copied to the clipboard into your favorite text editor. As you'll
        see, it's basically the PSID header in plain text. "Paste" doesn't
        require all those PSID fields to be present in the clipboard, thus,
        you can paste only a subset of those fields into PSID files.

    *   (added) Added a button titled "HVSC Filename" that makes the
        filename HVSC compliant (essentially, POSIX compliant). What it does
        to create the filename is basically the same thing that Shark's
        SID2LFN tool does. The filename it creates is not gospel (I lack the
        time to code up an AI engine in Perl ;), but a very good guess at
        what the filename should be if you want your rip to be in HVSC.

    *   (added) Added POD to the script. The description also contains a
        real-life example of how I imagine this PSIDedit tool to be used by
        rippers.

  v1.60 (PSIDedit) (01/14/2002)

    *   (added) Using Audio::PSID instead of PSID.pm.

  v1.58 (PSIDedit) (12/16/2001)

    *   (fixed) Update file lists if file is saved with different name.

    *   (added) Ability to edit dataOffset.

  v1.56 (PSIDedit) (12/08/2001)

    First public release. Lots of changes and additions.

  v1.00 (PSIDedit) (09/29/1999)

    First release.
