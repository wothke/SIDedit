<p>SIDedit - A Perl/Tk GUI based application to read and edit binary SID files.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>This Perl/Tk GUI application allows the user to read, write and edit binary
SID files, which are music player and data routines converted from the
Commodore-64 computer with an additional informational header prepended.
<strong>SIDedit</strong> has become a useful tool for people ripping SID tunes out of
Commodore-64 executables.</p>
<p>Most of the application's common functions should be obvious, and for some of
the less obvious ones tooltips provide additional hints.</p>
<p>This tool is intended for programmers, SID rippers, or other people with
reasonable background. It is not suitable for newbies who have never before
used hexadecimal numbers, who are not familiar with the Commodore-64
computer's internals or with the SID file format (click <em>Help -</em> SID file
format&gt; on the menu for the format specification).</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="usage">USAGE</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="a_short_tutorial__i_just_ripped_a_tune___now_what">A SHORT TUTORIAL: I JUST RIPPED A TUNE - NOW WHAT?</a></h2>
<p>Let's say you just ripped a SID tune and it's sitting on your hard drive as
a Commodore-64 executable and you want to turn it into a standard SID file
so it can be incorporated into the High Voltage SID Collection.</p>
<p>Let's assume that your freshly ripped tune is in a file called <em class="file">Ripped.prg</em>.
(<strong>SIDedit</strong> recognizes a file as a C64 data file only if its extension is one
of .prg, .p00, .c64 or .dat.) Start up <strong>SIDedit</strong>, check the <strong>List C64 data
files</strong> checkbox and navigate to the directory where this file can be found.
Click on the file. <strong>SIDedit</strong> will ask you whether you want to load it as SID
data. Answer yes. <strong>SIDedit</strong> also asks you whether you want to reset the SID
header data to the defaults. For now answer yes to this question, too. The
binary data from Ripped.prg gets loaded into <strong>SIDedit</strong>.</p>
<p>Now all you have to do is edit the SID header and save the resulting file.
Remember that when you change any field in the <em>SID header</em> in <strong>SIDedit</strong>,
you are editing an in-memory copy of the SID file, not the SID file itself!
Once you are done with your changes, you'll have to save them to a file to
make the changes permanent.</p>
<p>First, decide whether your rip is PlaySID compatible or requires a real C64
environment to play properly. See the next section below for a detailed
discussion about this. When you decided, set the <em>Environment</em> field to your
choice.</p>
<p>Then, make sure that the <em>Load range</em> displayed in <strong>SIDedit</strong> is the same as
the one you used when you saved the file. If it isn't, enter the load address
in the <em>loadAddress</em> field and make sure the <strong>Always save as PSID v2NG/RSID</strong>
option is checked in the <em>Configure settings</em> window under the <em>File
navigator</em> tab, otherwise leave the <em>loadAddress</em> field at 0. (NOTE: if you
selected <em>Real C64</em> as the rip's environment, you can't edit the
<em>loadAddress</em> field!)</p>
<p>Then, at a minimum, you should edit the <em>initAddress</em> and <em>playAddress</em>
hexadecimal fields (leave <em>playAddress</em> as 0 only if the initialization
routine of the ripped tune installs an interrupt player itself - this will
always be set to 0 for <em>Real C64</em> rips and you won't be able to change it),
the <em>songs</em> and <em>startSong</em> decimal fields (both should be at least 1), and,
of course, the textual <em>name</em>, <em>author</em> and <em>released</em> fields that should
conform to HVSC standards (read the HVSC FAQ for details on that or hover with
the mouse over those fields to see their tooltips for examples).</p>
<p>If certain (or all) subsongs of your rip use different timers, you might also
want to edit the <em>speed</em> field. (NOTE: You can't do this if your rip is a
<em>Real C64</em> rip.) The easiest way to do this is to click on the <strong>Edit speed
bits</strong> button, where you can set the speed of the individual subsongs. Due to
the SID file format's limitation, subsongs #32 and higher are all represented
by 1 bit only, so they'll all have the same speed. This is rarely a problem,
though.</p>
<p>Next you should edit the <em>flags</em> field. Again, instead of typing in the
actual hexadecimal value for this field it's easier if you simply click on the
<strong>Edit the flags</strong> button. Here you can specify whether your rip uses a built-
in player or not (it most likely does), and whether it's fully C64 compatible
or it's PlaySID specific (note: this latter setting is not an available choice
for <em>Real C64</em> rips). For example, if your rip plays digi samples and you
didn't alter the original player routine, it's definitely a fully C64
compatible rip. If you modified the player routine so that it plays the digi
samples via the extended PlaySID registers (not recommended), then you should
definitely check the <strong>PlaySID specific</strong> checkbutton. For <em>Real C64</em> rips
check the <strong>C64 BASIC executable</strong> checkbox if the ripped tunes uses BASIC
instructions.</p>
<p>You should also specify here whether the tune you ripped was intended for PAL
or NTSC machines (or maybe it works on both), and also whether it was intended
by its author to be played on a 6581 or 8580 chip (or maybe both). Then press
<strong>Done</strong>, and the <em>flags</em> field will be automatically updated for you.</p>
<p>To help SID emulators determine where they should install their interrupt
routines, you may want to specify the area of memory that is definitely not
used by your ripped tune. Usually this is a problem only when the
initialization or player routine reads or writes to memory that is outside the
<em>Load range</em>. If this is the case, you should specify the address of the
first free 256 byte large memory page in <em>startPage</em> and the number of free
pages following that in <em>pageLength</em>. For example, startPage = $30 and
pageLength = $10 indicates that the memory area between $3000 and $3FFF is
never touched by your ripped tune.</p>
<p>A common example for how to fill out the different SID fields is below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Environment</em>: <em>PlaySID</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>loadAddress</em>: $0000 (or set it to the actual load address if <em>Load range</em>
shows a seemingly incorrect memory range)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>initAddress</em>: $1000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>playAddress</em>: $1003</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>songs</em>: 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>startSong</em>: 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>speed</em>: 0x00000000 (indicating the the tune uses the vertical sync for
timing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>name</em>: My Love is Infinite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>author</em>: John Doe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>released</em>: 2004 BoyBand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>flags</em>: 0x0014 (indicating a fully C64 compatible rip with a built-in player
that was intended for PAL machines and to be played back on 6581 chips)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>startPage</em>: $00 (indicating that the rip is &quot;clean&quot;, i.e. it doesn't write
outside its <em>Load range</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>pageLength</em>: $00 (if <em>startPage</em> is $00, <em>pageLength</em> should be $00, too)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now click on the <strong>Create HVSC compliant filename</strong> button. This will -
surprisingly - create an HVSC compliant filename out of the SID's name,
in this case it'll create the filename <em class="file">My_Love_is_Infinite.sid</em>. Then make
sure the <strong>Always save as PSID v2NG/RSID</strong> option is checked in the <em>Configure
settings</em> window and save the file by clicking on the <strong>Save file</strong> button on
the toolbar. That's it! (You can also save the SID file to a different
directory by choosing <strong>File -</strong> Save as...&gt; from the menu.)</p>
<p>If you ripped more than one tune from the same author, you might want to do
the following to save you from typing in his name for every rip: after doing
the above procedure, make sure the little checkbuttons by the <em>author</em> and
<em>released</em> fields are checked and all the other ones are not. Make sure the
<strong>Edit -</strong> Copy format -&gt; Selected fields only&gt; menu option is also checked,
then select <strong>Edit -</strong> Copy&gt; from the menu or press <strong>CTRL-C</strong>. This will copy
the above two SID fields as text to the clipboard. Now you can go on and add
a SID header to your next rip as outlined above, but instead of typing in the
author and release info, simply select <strong>Edit -</strong> Paste&gt; from the menu or
press <strong>CTRL-V</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="a_few_words_about_the_environment_setting__playsid_vs__real_c64_">A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT SETTING (PlaySID vs. Real C64)</a></h2>
<p>You'll notice there is a setting labeled <em>Environment</em> that can be set either
to <strong>PlaySID</strong> or to <strong>Real C64</strong>. When it is set to <strong>PlaySID</strong>, <strong>SIDedit</strong> will
save the SID to a valid PSID v1 or v2/v2NG file depending on the other
settings. When it is set to <strong>Real C64</strong>, the data will always be saved to an
RSID (RealSID) file, which is basically a PSID v2NG file with its magic ID set
to 'RSID' instead of 'PSID'.</p>
<p>The main difference between the two settings is that <strong>Real C64</strong> indicates
that the rip requires a true Commodore-64 environment to operate properly and
won't even play in (or might even crash!) older libsidplay1 and PlaySID
compatible SID emulators. The advantage of RSID files is that they can be run
on a real C64 unmodified. For this reasons it is highly recommended to save
every SID file as an RSID (Real C64 file). See the <em class="file">SID_file_format.txt</em> file
included with <strong>SIDedit</strong> for further details (it is discussed under the
'magicID' field).</p>
<p>Setting the environment to <strong>Real C64</strong> also enforces additional restrictions
on top of PSID v2NG: it automatically sets the <em>loadAddress</em>, <em>playAddress</em>
and <em>speed</em> fields to 0 and modifying these fields is no longer possible,
plus changing the bit in the <em>flags</em> field to make the file <em>PlaySID
specific</em> will be no longer possible, either. Also, the <em>initAddress</em> and the
relocation range indicated by <em>startPage</em> and <em>pageLength</em> cannot be inside
or overlap the ROM/IO ($A000-$BFFF and $D000-$FFFF) areas, <em>initAddress</em>
cannot be lower than $07E8 and the relocation range cannot overlap the
reserved memory area ($0000-$03FF).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="displaying__editing_and_saving_the_c64_data">DISPLAYING, EDITING AND SAVING THE C64 DATA</a></h2>
<p>When you press the <strong>Display SID data</strong> button, a new window pops up. Here you
can select whether you want to display the <em>data</em> portion of a SID file as a
<strong>Hex dump</strong>, or as disassembled machine code (<strong>Assembly</strong> checkbutton), or as
disassembled machine code showing the illegal instructions, too. Note that
when you display the data as <strong>Hex dump</strong>, for your convenience C64 ASCII
characters (both uppercase and lowercase) will be shown as standard ASCII
characters on the screen. Also note that when the data is shown as assembly
code, you can click on certain jump and branch addresses to jump to that
address directly without scrolling to it. Also, when you switch from assembly
to hex dump mode or vice versa, the topmost line of the display will be at
approximately the same address where it was in the previous display mode.</p>
<p>You can specify the first memory address from which the data will be shown
by choosing either the <strong>Load address</strong>, the <strong>initAddress</strong>, the
<strong>playAddress</strong>, or an arbitrary memory address (<strong>Other</strong>) as the starting
point for the display.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="saving_sid_data">SAVING SID DATA</a></h3>
<p>You can also save the C64 <em>data</em> portion of a SID to a file by clicking the
<strong>Save data to file</strong> button. Choosing the <strong>as binary</strong> option will save it to
a standard C64 binary file with a .prg extension, while choosing the <strong>as
displayed</strong> option will save the actual content of the data display into a
plain text file. Choosing the <strong>as 64 KB memory image</strong> option will create a
binary file with an .img extension that is exactly 65536 bytes large and is
basically a snapshot of the C64's 64 KB memory with the <em>data</em> portion of the
SID file at the appropriate memory address location. Therefore, if you hex
edit the resulting .img file, the offsets in your hex editor will match that
of the actual offsets when the <em>data</em> is loaded into the C64's memory.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="changing_the_size_of_the_sid_data">CHANGING THE SIZE OF THE SID DATA</a></h3>
<p>The window also gives you an opportunity to change the size of the C64
<em>data</em>. You can enter a new load range for the <em>data</em> in the <strong>Trim/pad
data</strong> section. If the new range you specify is greater than the current load
range at either end, the C64 <em>data</em> gets filled with zeros accordingly. If
the new range you specify is smaller than the current load range at either
end, the C64 <em>data</em> portion gets trimmed (chopped) as specified. Pressing the
<strong>Trim/pad data</strong> button carries out the change and it also updates the
appropriate SID header data. WARNING: if you reduce the <em>data</em> portion
there's no other way of getting back the cut data other than reloading the
file! Be careful with this button!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="modifying_bytes_in_sid_data">MODIFYING BYTES IN SID DATA</a></h3>
<p>Finally, you can also modify a contiguous string of bytes in the <em>data</em>
portion by clicking on <strong>Modify bytes</strong>. This is very useful if you want to
add, say, a short sequence of assembly instructions to the SID data.</p>
<p>First specify the C64 address from
which you want to modify bytes, then specify the bytes that you want to change
it to in the format of &quot;xx xx xx ...&quot; where 'xx' are hexadecimal bytes. For
example, setting <strong>At address</strong> to $1000 and the <strong>change bytes to</strong> to &quot;AB BA&quot;
will change the C64 <em>data</em> portion at $1000 to hex $AB and at $1001 to hex
$BA. Needless to say, don't do byte modifications unless you are absolutely
sure about what you are doing as you can really mess up the SID file with
incorrect byte modifications here.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="file_navigator">FILE NAVIGATOR</a></h2>
<p>The left-hand side of the main <strong>SIDedit</strong> window is dedicated to the file
navigator. You can use the file navigator to browse directories, load SID
files into <strong>SIDedit</strong>, play SID files by double-clicking on them, etc.
If the directory listing is long, you can also type the first few letters of
the file or directory you'd like to jump to after making the given listbox
active by rolling your mouse pointer over it.</p>
<p>The file navigator also has its own toolbar. Besides the usual buttons, like
<strong>Go to parent directory</strong>, <strong>Create new directory</strong> and <strong>Delete selected
directory</strong> there are also a few so-called directory shortcut buttons. You can
use these to jump directly to certain frequently used directories, like to the
directory where you usually save your SID files to, or to go to your HVSC
directory. You configure where these shortcuts point to on the <strong>Configure
settings</strong> window under the <strong>File navigator</strong> tab.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="loading_info_files">LOADING INFO FILES</a></h2>
<p><strong>SIDedit</strong> is also capable of loading SID header data from so-called INFO
files which usually have a <em>.sid</em> file extension. These files were part of a
now obsolete two-file SID file format.</p>
<p>Check the <strong>List INFO files</strong> checkbox at the top of the file navigator in
<strong>SIDedit</strong> to see a list of such files in the file navigator. Once you click on
an INFO file, <strong>SIDedit</strong> will ask you whether you want to overload the current
SID header data in the memory with the one contained in the INFO file. Answer
yes to carry out this operation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="playing_your_rip_in_a_sid_emulator">PLAYING YOUR RIP IN A SID EMULATOR</a></h2>
<p>After saving a SID file you probably want to make sure it plays correctly in
your favorite SID emulator. <strong>SIDedit</strong> can launch your favorite SID player
with a selected file as outlined below.</p>
<p>First, select the <strong>Tools</strong> tab in the <strong>Configure settings</strong> window to tell
<strong>SIDedit</strong> which SID player you would like to use for this feature.</p>
<p>Then you can launch your SID player either by clicking on the <strong>Play SID
file</strong> button on the toolbar, or by double-clicking on the file. If you
didn't configure a SID player, yet, <strong>SIDedit</strong> will automatically pop up
the <strong>Configure settings</strong> window to prompt you for the location of the
SID emulator you want to use to play the file.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="editing_your_rip_with_a_hex_editor">EDITING YOUR RIP WITH A HEX EDITOR</a></h2>
<p>You might also want to edit the <em>data</em> portion of the SID file after you
saved the file. You can do this with your favorite hex editor from within
<strong>SIDedit</strong> by clicking the <strong>Edit file with hex editor</strong> button on the
toolbar.</p>
<p>First, select the <strong>Tools</strong> tab in the <strong>Configure settings</strong> window to tell
<strong>SIDedit</strong> which hex editor you would like to use for this feature.</p>
<p>Then you can start your hex editor by clicking on the <strong>Edit file with hex
editor</strong> button.</p>
<p>If you didn't configure a hex editor, yet, <strong>SIDedit</strong> will automatically pop
up the <strong>Configure settings</strong> window to prompt you for the location of the
hex editor you want to use for this purpose.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="checking_your_rip_with_an_external_tool">CHECKING YOUR RIP WITH AN EXTERNAL TOOL</a></h2>
<p>After saving a SID file you might want to run an external tool like SID2CRC to
make sure that your rip is a pristine SID tune. Select the SID file in the
file navigator then click the <strong>Run command line tool</strong> button on the toolbar.
Here you can enter a command line that will execute your tool in a shell or
choose from a list of previously executed tools (the list remembers the last
10 commands you ran and this list is also saved with other settings to
<em class="file">SIDedit.INI</em>).</p>
<p>For example, assuming that sid2crc is in your path, enter
<em>sid2crc -v -t80000 -m %f</em> at the command line entry. <em>%f</em> will be replaced
with the full pathname of the file you selected in the file navigator. You can
also use <em>%d</em> to substitute the full pathname of the current directory shown
in the file navigator of <strong>SIDedit</strong>, or <em>%x</em> to subsitute the full pathname of
the selected file without its extension. Now click the <strong>Run command line
tool</strong> button and the command line you entered will be executed.</p>
<p>The output of the command will appear in a new pop-up window. (If you see
nothing here, the command you entered most likely failed.) There are two
additional buttons on this window that also allow you to save the command's
output to a file and to copy the contents of the output to the clipboard. You
can also pop up this window any time by clicking the <strong>Run tool</strong> button in the
main <strong>SIDedit</strong> window and then clicking <strong>Show last output</strong> or by choosing
<strong>File -</strong> Show last output of tool...&gt; from the menu - as its name suggests
it will always show you the output of the most recent command you executed.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="saving_your_settings">SAVING YOUR SETTINGS</a></h2>
<p>When you quit <strong>SIDedit</strong>, it automatically saves your settings to a
<em class="file">SIDedit.INI</em> file that will be located in the same directory from where you
started <strong>SIDedit</strong> itself. If you want to disable this feature, uncheck the
<strong>Always save settings on exit</strong> option on the <strong>General</strong> tab in the <strong>Configure
settings</strong> window and click <strong>Save settings now</strong> - from now on, <strong>SIDedit</strong> will
read the settings from the <em class="file">SIDedit.INI</em> file, but it won't save your changes
to it when you quit the program. You can also force <strong>SIDedit</strong> to save the
current settings to the <em class="file">SIDedit.INI</em> file any time by clicking on the &lt;Save
settings now&gt; in the same window.</p>
<p>Note that besides all the settings available on the <strong>Configure settings</strong> menu,
<strong>SIDedit</strong> also saves the settings of all the options available via the <strong>Edit</strong>
menu, the list of the last 10 commands that were executed with the <strong>Run command
line tool</strong> feature, plus the last size and position of the main SIDedit window
and some other windows.</p>

<h1><a name="known_bugs">KNOWN BUGS</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data display rendering and clipboard operations are way too slow with colors
(try new Perl/Tk?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under UNIX bringing up the display data window caused a grab fail.
(Bug in Perl/Tk?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On some systems if you press down on the mousewheel button and move down,
the SID data scrolls up, and moving up scrolls down (it should be the other
way around).
(Bug in Perl/Tk.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's a problem with the scrollbar on the data display window when
&quot;assembly&quot; is selected: it doesn't always scroll all the way down when grabbed
with the scrollblock.
(Bug in Perl/Tk.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checked items in the menu partially cover first letter of menu entry.
(Bug in Perl/Tk.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After selecting File-&gt;New last file doesn't get deselected in the filelist.
(Bug in Perl/Tk - can't deselect from listbox.)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="to_do_list">TO DO LIST</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Disassembly rendering (when jumping to address or switching views) should
always re-start at proper address (instead of in the middle of an
instruction).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RunTool execution should have a WaitBox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restrict Play SID file to actual SID/INFO files only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DirTree browser doesn't quite work in Win32. Try chooseDirectory instead?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add key bindings to Configure settings popup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add popup to show quick summary of assembly codes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add File -&gt; Open... (rip out a Load function from FileSelect).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add &quot;Load data&quot; to SID data display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'd like to have SIDedit remember the last x directories I worked in.
Sometimes I quickly need to change between my rip directory and the HVSC
directory to compare something, so it would be nice to implement a similar
history function as in the RUN TOOL window. (Add &lt;- and -&gt; nav buttons!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimize Load/Save Settings code (hash! - use Config::IniHash or sg).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimize Settings screen code (map!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add right-click menu to file navigator. Prune right-click menu on SID data
and text display? (Selection problem!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add mm file analyzation support, see SidUsage files!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change &quot;name&quot; field to &quot;Title&quot; (In Audio::SID, too).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add an info field to &quot;Show SID Data&quot; that shows which SID player engine is
used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add option to allow users to revert back to standard copy/paste operations
(i.e. select a field, copy it). (BUT: $window-&gt;<code>clipboardPaste()</code> doesn't work,
neither does $window-&gt;insert - great...)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a button called &quot;Batch processing&quot;. In there one option would be to
generate a text output of checked fields recursively in current dir, another
option would be to change the checked fields in all files recursively to what
is in current file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simon: I still wish something could be done about it like say combining load
address and range (make load address always reflect the range start address).
Then by changing load address you'll see the range change.  Also might be nice
if you then click display data the new load address is used...  You could even
combine load address and range into a single line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the ShowSIDData and ShowTextOutput windows on screen, don't grab, so they
can be displayed side-by-side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add Dag's code to fill out startPage and pageLength automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add ability to recurse dirs and autoconvert SID files as per specified
options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load MD5s from expanded Songlengths DB to find SIDs already in HVSC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow siddiag duplicate match against HVSC. Or in general incorporate a
duplicate finder?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add ability to search every field of every SID found in HVSC and/or other
specified directories. Sort of like SidBace. Build a text DB for this. Add
search capability for Songlength DB, STIL, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="v4_02___11_08_2020_by_tiny_r_sid_">v4.02+ (11/08/2020 by Tiny'R'Sid)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added &quot;List all files&quot; option so that binaries can be loaded without having 
 to rename them to &quot;*.prg&quot; first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added browsing support for Windows folder names containing non-ASCII characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added "selection replace" when pasting into directory field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed flawed regexp so it no longer crashes for windows filenames containing dots or brackets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disassembly view now uses regular 3-char mnemonics for illegal opcodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patched so it works with Perl and module versions still available today.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="v4_02__03_13_2004_">v4.02 (03/13/2004)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(added)
  All illegal assembly instructions are colored red in the data display when
  syntax coloring is turned on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  A line consisting of dashes is displayed after every JMP and RTS
  instruction in the data display to improve readability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  Added configuration setting &quot;Automatically create HVSC compliant filename
  when 'name' field changes&quot;. Turning on this setting automatically changes
  the filename to be HVSC compliant whenever the 'name' field changes, and
  it also gets rid of the pop-up confirmation window when the &quot;Create HVSC
  compliant filename&quot; button is pressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Added missing '$' signs when displaying conditional branch instruction
  addresses in the data display.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="v4_01__02_15_2004_">v4.01 (02/15/2004)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(added)
  New setting to turn off syntax coloring in data display to speed up
  display and clipboard operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  Version history in the POD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  Broke up content of INI file into 4 sections within the file for better
  readability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Colors were one off on the hex data display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  There was a problem entering the &quot;Other&quot; address in the data display.
  It caused focus problem, data rendering problem, etc. The address entry is
  now enabled permanently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="v4_00__02_02_2004_">v4.00 (02/02/2004)</a></h2>
<p>You'll notice that the user interface of SIDedit has undergone some
significant upgrades which will hopefully make it easier to use. The basic
functionality of SIDedit hasn't changed much, though.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: If you're installing this version of SIDedit over the old one, I
strongly advise you to -DELETE- your existing SIDedit.ini file to remove the
chance of some weird bug happening. Upon first starting SIDedit v4.00, select
&quot;Tools&quot; -&gt; &quot;Configure settings&quot;, then click &quot;Save settings now&quot; to re-create
the SIDedit.ini file.</p>
<p>If you are using the UNIX/Perl version (i.e the SIDedit.pl file from the
tarball) you'll notice that you'll have to install a few new Perl/Tk modules
to get SIDedit running. It's inconvenient, I know, but it was the only way I
could add some cool new widgets to the tool.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(added)
  Added support for the new 'C64 BASIC' RSID flag. (Thanks to Simon White!)
  Click on &quot;Edit flags&quot; to set or clear this flag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  Added rudimentary support to modify a continuous string of bytes in the SID
  data itself. See &quot;Display SID data&quot; -&gt; &quot;Modify bytes&quot;. Consult the
  &quot;Modifying Bytes in SID Data&quot; section of the &quot;Help&quot; -&gt; &quot;Quick tutorial&quot;
  guide for details on its usage. (WARNING: You can really mess up a SID file
  with this, so use it with extreme care!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  Major overhaul of the user interface includes (but is not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    SIDedit now uses menus and toolbars for easy access
    to most functions.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    Help screens use external files.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    File -&gt; New to reset SID data to defaults.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    File -&gt; Save as... to save file to arbitrary location.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    The main window and the data display make use of colors.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    In the data display window it is now possible to click
    on the jump/branch addresses to jump to that location
    directly (if that location can be displayed in the window).</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    In the data display window switching between hex dump
    and assembly listings retains the currently displayed
    address range in the window.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    All the settings are now configurable via a separate
    &quot;Configure settings&quot; popup window.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    Experimental mousewheel support. (NOTE: on some systems
    if you press down on the mousewheel button and move down,
    the window contents scroll up, and moving up scrolls them
    down instead of the other way around. This seems to be a
    bug in Perl/Tk itself.)</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    The file navigator window pane also got its own toolbar
    with 3 directory &quot;shortcuts&quot; (default dir, default save
    dir, HVSC dir) which are configurable via the &quot;Configure
    settings&quot; popup window. You can use these shortcuts to
    jump to those dirs without navigating to them.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    Toolbar icons that are lifted from Tk::Toolbar -&gt; tkIcons.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    Errors that would be displayed on the command line are now
    displayed in an error message box.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    Window positions are retained and also saved to
    configuration file.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    &quot;Please wait&quot; popup window when SID data display rendering
    takes a long time.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
  (added)
    Jumping between hex and assembly display in the SID data
    display retains location from the previous display mode.</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  The POD is now in its separate .pod file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  Added &quot;%x&quot; command line substitution pattern to the &quot;Run Tool&quot; feature to
  allow full pathname without file extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Additional verification of playAddress and initAddress fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Pressing delete and backspace in the SID fields will also flag the in-memory
  file as modified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Sub-windows now properly take and release focus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  InitAddress and playAddress are grayed out in the SID data display if they
  are zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Saving a file with the same name but different case now saves the file with
  the new cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  If &quot;List INFO files&quot; is checked, loading of data files is no longer messed
  up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Lots and lots of small bugfixes. Hopefully, I managed to fix all the bugs
  that were reported since the previous version was released. :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of you might notice that in the Windows version of SIDedit there is no
&quot;Browse&quot; button next to the directory shortcut entries in the &quot;Configure
settings&quot; window. Unfortunately, this is due to a shortcoming of the Perl/Tk
interface and hopefully it'll be fixed when Tk-804 is released.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="v3_02__11_22_2002_">v3.02 (11/22/2002)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(added)
  Changed the &quot;copyright&quot; field name to &quot;released&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  The load range wasn't calculated correctly when the relocation range was
  checked, causing incorrect error reports before saving an RSID file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  The lowest acceptable load and init address in RSID files was lowered to
  $07E8. (Ask Simon if you are curious why. :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="v3_01__11_03_2002_">v3.01 (11/03/2002)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  There was a bug in the code that was checking the relocation range for RSID
  files, it sometimes reported a perfectly valid relocation range (e.g.
  startPage = $9F, pageLength = $01) as invalid. It won't do that any more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="v3_00__10_29_2002_">v3.00 (10/29/2002)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(added)
  The tool's name was changed from PSIDedit to SIDedit. Note that this means
  that you'll have to rename your PSIDedit.ini file to SIDedit.ini and change
  the first line in it to &quot;[SIDedit]&quot; if you want to retain your old settings!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  The tool requires the new Audio::SID v3.00 module to work (if you're using
  the Win32 executable, you don't have to worry about this).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  There's a new field labeled &quot;Environment&quot; in the SID header section. You
  can select either &quot;PlaySID&quot; (PSID) or &quot;Real C64&quot; (RSID) here. This basically
  sets the magic ID in the SID file to PSID or RSID. Selecting RSID enforces
  additional restrictions over PSID v2NG - see the included documentation for
  details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  Additional full support for RSID, like relocation info fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  The &quot;HVSC Filename&quot; button is now called &quot;Create HVSC Filename&quot;. Hopefully,
  this'll make its function a bit more understandable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  With the new name comes a slightly different icon - thanks to Peter Sandén
  for taking the time to create it for me! :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  If you change the loadAddress field, its new value is now properly
  reflected in the data display window, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Changing the CLOCK field didn't automatically regenerate the MD5
  fingerprint. Fixed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Pressing CTRL+&lt;Key&gt; or ALT+&lt;Key&gt; (and nothing else) in the text
  entry fields of the SID header no longer pops up the &quot;Save file?&quot; dialog
  window if you move to another file right away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  The &quot;funny&quot; texts on buttons of error popup windows are gone.
  Apparently, many of you didn't think they were funny. So, now the only
  button you can press there simply says &quot;OK&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  The &quot;Run tool&quot; feature didn't work properly if the full pathname of
  the file you tried to operate on contained a space. Fixed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Many other minor internal enhancements made to the tool.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="v2_12__psidedit___09_18_2002_">v2.12 (PSIDedit) (09/18/2002)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(added)
  The &quot;HVSC Filename&quot; button will automatically append &quot;_PSID&quot; to the
  filename if the PlaySID flag is set. (Although the filename might still
  require some manual editing to make it &quot;look better&quot;.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  In almost all dialog boxes you can now press hotkeys, too. If the
  hotkeys don't seem to work, try CTRL+hotkey or ALT+hotkey. For example, in
  a Yes/No dialog box you can simply press the &quot;Y&quot; or &quot;N&quot; keys to answer the
  question. In the &quot;Data display&quot; window you can press CTRL+O to close the
  window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  The &quot;HVSC Filename&quot; button now handles &quot;+&quot; signs in titles correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Zero-length filenames are no longer allowed when saving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  The MD5 fingerprints are now calculated with the new algorithm (so
  for files in HVSC they will match those found in the latest songlength
  database).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="v2_11__psidedit___08_21_2002_">v2.11 (PSIDedit) (08/21/2002)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Minor bugfixes in HVSC compliant filename generation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Removed references to &quot;Amiga&quot; in speed bit edit popup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="v2_10__psidedit___08_05_2002_">v2.10 (PSIDedit) (08/05/2002)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(added)
  Ability to load INFO files (these are text files that were part
  of the now obsolete .dat + .sid two-file format). PSIDedit also
  handles newer INFO files that contain PSID v2NG fields in them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  A new button called &quot;Run tool&quot; allows the user to run any
  external tool in a command shell right from PSIDedit. The output
  of such commands is captured in a window - the contents of
  this window can then be saved to a file or copied to the clipboard.
  This new button was added mainly to allow rippers to run sid2crc
  right from PSIDedit which allows them to check SID files. PSIDedit
  will remember the last 10 command lines entered here and this
  command list is also saved to the PSIDedit.ini file with other
  settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  On the &quot;Display C64 data&quot; window a new button was added called
  &quot;Trim/pad data&quot; that allows the user to alter the size of the C64
  data in a PSID file. This is great to trim a ripped file to get
  rid of superfluous bytes from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  Pressing an alphanumeric key when the dir/file browser is in focus
  will cycle thru the dirs/files that begin with that letter. If you
  start typing rapidly, the first file whose name starts with the typed
  letters will be highlighted, similar to Windows Explorer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  When moving up the dir hierarchy via the dir browser the previous
  directory's name will be automatically highlighted (instead of the
  name of the very first dir entry).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Minor bugfixes in the &quot;HVSC filename&quot; feature that generates an
  HVSC-compliant filename based on the &quot;name&quot; field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Copying data to the clipboard INFO style had some bugs in it. Got
  rid of them. Similarly, pasting INFO style data from the clipboard
  was also buggy. Fixed that, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Loading data files (.dat, .prg, etc.) will no longer reset the
  PSID header data to defaults automatically. You now have a choice
  whether to keep the PSID header data or not. This will save
  you a copy-paste step when, for example, constructing several SID
  files in a row from data files that were ripped from the same author.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  If you tried to play a SID file under Windows whose full pathname
  contained a space, SIDPlay/Win used to give an error. Fixed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Other minor (mostly internal) enhancements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="v2_02__psidedit___07_22_2002_">v2.02 (PSIDedit) (07/22/2002)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Apostrophe handling for titles containg 'n' and underscores when
  creating HVSC compliant filename.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="v2_01__psidedit___04_22_2002_">v2.01 (PSIDedit) (04/22/2002)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(added)
  New tooltips were added to the 'author' and 'copyright' fields to show
  the suggested format for those fields (actually, that is pretty much how
  HVSC requires them to look like - consult the /DOCUMENTS/hv_sids.txt file
  of your HVSC collection for details).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  Fixed a minor bug in the 'songs' and 'startSong' entry fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  The tabbing order amongst the PSID header fields is now a bit more
  convenient (TAB won't cycle through the little checkboxes any more).</p>
</li>
</ul>

  code (with or without illegal instructions),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)

<h2><a name="v1_60c__psidedit___01_23_2002_">v1.60c (PSIDedit) (01/23/2002)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(added)
  MD5 fingerprint is updated on the fly as the PSID header is edited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  PSIDedit is now also available as a standalone Windows executable!
  No installation needed - just run it and enjoy. :) But since it was created
  with the evaluation version of Perl2EXE, you'll see a nag-window come up
  after you close PSIDedit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(fixed)
  HVSC root filename is only 26 characters long, not 27.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h2><a name="v1_60b__psidedit___01_20_2002_">v1.60b (PSIDedit) (01/20/2002)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(added)
  You can now not only copy PSID header information to the clipboard,
  but you can also paste properly formatted header info from the clipboard
  into the PSID file you are editing by pressing the new &quot;Paste&quot; button. To
  find out what &quot;properly formatted&quot; means, simply load a PSID file, press
  &quot;Copy&quot;, then paste what was just copied to the clipboard into your favorite
  text editor. As you'll see, it's basically the PSID header in plain text.
  &quot;Paste&quot; doesn't require all those PSID fields to be present in the clipboard,
  thus, you can paste only a subset of those fields into PSID files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  Added a button titled &quot;HVSC Filename&quot; that makes the filename HVSC
  compliant (essentially, POSIX compliant). What it does to create the filename
  is basically the same thing that Shark's SID2LFN tool does. The filename it
  creates is not gospel (I lack the time to code up an AI engine in Perl ;),
  but a very good guess at what the filename should be if you want your rip to
  be in HVSC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(added)
  Added POD to the script. The description also contains a real-life
  example of how I imagine this PSIDedit tool to be used by rippers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
